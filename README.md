# ---------------------------- HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM ------------------------------- #
for how to use the program read at the and of the section
# ---------------------------- INITIAL GOAL ------------------------------- #
The goal is to write a simple Python code that allows me to automate
redundant tasks such as sending birthday wishes, etc.
To achieve this, I'm going to use the smtplib and datetime modules.
Learning goal: With this project, my aim is to briefly explore these
two modules, so i have to acess to a txt file with some quotes, 
randomly pick up a quote, checking the today date, if today date 
mach with birthday ( or even date ), of one of the person in the list that 
user can generate, insering the data on the form and adding it the the list, the program will 
sent a email with a random quote to a specified person.

I will upgrade it with a little GUI using Tkinter at a later time.
us random module as well for the random selection of the quote to send.

# ---------------------------- IMPROVEMENT TO DO ------------------------------- #
During the development, I realized that the code assumes more 
and more of a spaghetti effect because, through the way, 
I added new features that came to mind. So, with God willing, 
I will implement OOP next time when I come back to this exercise, 
with new knowledge too

- OOP implementation
- User email and password acquisition in the GUI
- add receiver email to the data collected and using 
  it in the sending email func


# ---------------------------- WHAT I HAVE LEARN ------------------------------- #
I started this exercise with a few goals: reviewing the smtplib 
module and datetime module. But then, I added other things to 
keep them fresh in mind until consolidation.

- automating email sending operation
- Datetime module
- Smtplib module
- JSON
- Reading/writing files
- Graphical User Interface
- Tkinter
- Catching errors with try-except

# ---------------------------- ISTRUCTION ------------------------------- #

Set the code variable following the instructions in the comment. 
Once you launch the program, complete the label as requested. 
Pay attention to the character size because I do not change 
them to uppercase or lowercase in the code.
